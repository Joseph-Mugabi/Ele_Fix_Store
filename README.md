## Technology And Architecture
**MYSQL and JSON** for Databases, a layer of abstraction in SQLAlchemy, internal APIs to expose the databases to other APIs to be served
interface content from the client[FrontEnd]. The Storage engine without a schema is nothing less than storage engine, so i came with a 
schema and did the mapping of all data in SQLAlchemy. Since i needed a data layer of abstraction to that would handle a certain information
or data to make it easy for the ```client(FrontEnd)``` to access the data storage engine.
